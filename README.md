# What
This is a simple angular service implementation of the FlickrAPI for retrieving an Album from Flickr.
Note that you should normally never pass tokens for API's in Frontend architecture, you should
always encapsulate such tokens in environment variables or make such calls in the Backend to return
the data you require.

Although I do not condone this kind of "bad" programming, it is still possible to implement such functionality.
This purely a POC, use at own risk.

# Dependencies
This POC is dependent on X2JS (https://code.google.com/p/x2js/).
